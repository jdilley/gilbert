"""MCP (Model Context Protocol) client interfaces.

Defines the backend ABC and shared data types for client-side MCP support.
Gilbert consumes MCP tools from external MCP servers configured per-user or
per-role. Each concrete transport (stdio, HTTP, SSE) is an ``MCPBackend``;
the core ``MCPService`` owns lifecycle, visibility rules, and the adapter
that turns ``MCPToolSpec`` into Gilbert ``ToolDefinition`` records.

Part 1 supports the ``stdio`` transport only. Part 2 adds ``http`` / ``sse``
and Part 3 adds resources, prompts, and sampling — only tool support is
modeled here for now, and the types are designed to grow without breaking
the backend contract.
