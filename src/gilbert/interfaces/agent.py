"""Agent interface — entity dataclasses + AgentProvider protocol.

Replaces the old Goal/Run model with a multi-agent design:

- Agent — durable identity (persona, system prompt, procedural rules,
  heartbeat config, tool allowlist, avatar, lifetime cost).
- AgentMemory — per-agent learned facts; SHORT_TERM / LONG_TERM split.
- AgentTrigger — time / event / heartbeat trigger config rows.
- Commitment — opt-in short-lived follow-ups, surfaced in heartbeats.
- InboxSignal — durable wake-up tracking; message content lives in
  conversation rows, signal lifecycle (created → processed) lives here.
- Run — one execution of an agent's loop. Keyed by agent_id.

See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-04-agent-messaging-design.md.
