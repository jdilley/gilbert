# Gilbert

AI assistant for home and business automation. Extensible, plugin-driven architecture with discoverable services, device integrations, and AI capabilities.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python (3.12+), managed via uv
- **Database:** SQLite (local store), interface-abstracted for swappable backends
- **Storage API:** Generic document/entity store with query interface (not SQL-shaped). New entity types require no migrations.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker for dependent services
- **Testing:** pytest with mocks; database tests use a real test SQLite database
- **Logging:** Python logging framework throughout. Colored console output (stderr), file logging, and separate AI API call log.

## Architecture

### Interface-First Design

Everything is designed as an abstract interface (Python ABCs) with concrete implementations. This applies to:

- **Data layer** — e.g., `StorageBackend` ABC with `SQLiteStorage` implementation (swappable to PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Device integrations** — e.g., `LightController` ABC with `LutronRadioRA2Controller`, `CasetaController`, etc.
- **Service abstractions** — e.g., `SpeakerService` ABC with `SonosService`, `UniFiService`, etc.

New integrations are added by implementing the relevant interface, not by modifying core logic.

### Plugin System

Plugins are loaded from:
- **GitHub URLs** — fetched and installed at runtime
- **Local file paths** — for development or private plugins

Plugins implement published interfaces to extend Gilbert with new device types, integrations, or capabilities.

### Installation Data Directory (`.gilbert/`)

The `.gilbert/` folder is the per-installation data directory. It is **gitignored** and auto-created on first run. Users clone the repo and run it — no source files need editing.

Contents:
- `config.yaml` — per-installation config overrides
- `gilbert.db` — SQLite database
- `gilbert.log` / `ai_calls.log` — log files
- `plugins/` — cached plugins fetched from GitHub

### Configuration Layering

1. `gilbert.yaml` (committed) — sensible defaults, shipped with the repo
2. `.gilbert/config.yaml` (gitignored) — per-installation overrides, deep-merged on top

Users customize Gilbert by creating `.gilbert/config.yaml`. The deep merge means you only need to specify the values you want to change.

## Agent Memory System

Claude AI agents use a file-based memory system located at `.claude/memory/` to retain knowledge about Gilbert's services, integrations, architectural decisions, and other project details across conversations.

### How It Works

1. **Index file:** `.claude/memory/MEMORIES.md` contains a flat list of all memories. Each entry is a one-line description with a markdown link to the detailed memory file. This index is the only file loaded into context by default.
2. **Memory files:** Individual files in `.claude/memory/` named `memory-<slug>.md` containing detailed information about a specific topic.
3. **Loading on demand:** When working on a task, check the index to see if a relevant memory exists. If so, load the memory file for detailed context. **Always mention in the terminal when loading a memory** (e.g., "Loading memory: facial-recognition-service").

### Keeping Memories Current

**This is not optional.** Memories are how future Claude sessions understand the system. Treat them like documentation that matters.

- **Create** a memory after designing or implementing a new service, integration, or significant component.
- **Create** a memory after making a significant architectural decision — record the decision and rationale.
- **Update** a memory when its system changes — new fields, renamed classes, changed behavior, new dependencies.
- **Remove** a memory when its system is deleted or replaced. Delete the file and remove it from the index. Stale memories are worse than no memories.
- After learning something non-obvious about a third-party integration — capture it.
- At the end of any significant work session, review whether affected memories need updating.
- **Before every commit**, review all memories touched by the changes being committed. Update stale memories, delete obsolete ones, and create new ones for anything significant that was added. Do not commit code that makes existing memories inaccurate.

### Memory File Format

All memory files follow this template:

```markdown
# <Title>

## Summary
One or two sentences describing what this is.

## Details
Detailed information — interfaces involved, key classes, configuration,
how it connects to the rest of the system, design decisions and rationale,
gotchas, etc.

## Related
- Links to related memory files or source paths
```

### Index Format (MEMORIES.md)

```markdown
# Memories

- [Facial Recognition Service](memory-facial-recognition-service.md) — identifies users by their face via camera integrations
- [Lutron RadioRA2 Integration](memory-lutron-radiora2.md) — controls Lutron lighting and shades
```

### Rules

- Keep the index concise — one line per memory, under 120 characters.
- Memory file names use the pattern `memory-<slug>.md` with kebab-case slugs.
- Do not dump entire source files into memories. Capture the *knowledge* — what it is, why it exists, how it fits together.
- Always keep the index in sync when creating, renaming, or deleting memory files.

## Development Guidelines

- **Always write tests.** Unit tests use mocks for external dependencies. Database tests hit a real test SQLite database — no mocking the DB.
- **Interface first.** Define the ABC before writing the implementation. Implementations should be swappable without changing callers.
- **Type hints everywhere.** All function signatures must have type annotations.
- **No concrete dependencies in core.** Core code depends on interfaces, never on specific implementations. Use dependency injection.
